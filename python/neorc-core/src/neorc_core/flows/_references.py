"""What a reference resolves to, for a consumer at a given place in a run.

The "Resolving references" table of docs/specs/flows.md, as functions. Every
loop or fan-out around the referenced step is, relative to the consumer, one of:

- a fan-out the consumer is in the same branch of: no list, that branch's value
- a fan-out the consumer is outside of: a list of every branch, by index
- a loop the consumer is inside of: a list of the iterations so far, current last
- a loop the consumer comes after: a list of every iteration

Each list level nests inside the previous one, outermost container first.

Pure code: a definition and a ``RunState`` in, a value out.
