"""Finding the Python function a task's handler names, and checking it fits.

A handler is ``module:function``, and only a function defined in a module
under the worker's code location is one. Whoever uploads a flow chooses its
handlers and their fixed params, so a handler that could name any importable
function, ``subprocess:run`` or ``os:system``, would let them run anything on
every worker. See docs/specs/workers-and-manager.md, "Handlers".

The module is imported one dotted part at a time, and each part is found as
the import system would find it before it is imported: a part found outside
the code location, or already imported from outside it, is refused before any
of its code runs. Since a package's submodules are found through the package,
no module elsewhere is ever imported. A module counts as under the code
location only at the path its name gives from there, ``a/b.py`` for ``a.b``:
a virtual environment inside the code location is not the worker's code, nor
is a package pip installed into it, found by the ``RECORD`` beside it. The
function must also have been defined in such a module, not imported into one
from elsewhere.
