"""What happens next for a run: pure, no I/O.

``plan`` looks at a run's definition and its state and returns the actions that
move it forward. It decides from the state alone, never from what happened
last, so asking twice, or after a redelivered event, plans the same actions;
publishing a task is idempotent by its address, so applying them twice is safe.

The scheduler gathers the input, calls ``plan`` and applies the actions. See
contributing/in-memory-first.md, rule 3.
