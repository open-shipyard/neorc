"""The worker for flows: check its queue's handlers, then take and run tasks.

Handlers are plain functions named by import path, called with a task's inputs
as keyword arguments; they need not import neorc. Only a function defined
under the worker's code location is a handler, whether it is checked by
``prepare`` or first met in a task: flows may be uploaded after the worker
started, and whoever uploads them names the handlers.

A refused token ends the worker: ``run`` raises the ``AuthenticationError``
rather than poll again. Refused while a handler runs, by a heartbeat, it ends
the handler too, since without heartbeats the lease lapses and another worker
may take the task: an async handler is cancelled, and a handler in a thread,
which cannot be, is left behind; ``run`` raises without waiting for it.
