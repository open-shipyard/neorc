"""The example scenarios: ``examples/hello`` and ``examples/wordplay`` run to their end.

Each function uploads an example's flows through a ``ManagerClient``, starts a
run, waits for it to finish, and asserts what it produced. What runs the
scheduler and the workers is the caller's choice: ``LocalCluster`` in memory,
or a deployment on Postgres and HTTP. The scenarios are the same either way,
which is the point.
