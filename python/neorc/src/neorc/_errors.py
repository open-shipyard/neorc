"""How a core error crosses HTTP, for the manager's routes and the clients alike.

Every ``NeorcError`` the manager raises answers with the status of its class
and a body naming the class::

    {"error": "RunStateError", "detail": "run ... is cancelled, no longer active"}

A ``FlowDefinitionError`` carries its ``problems`` too. Clients raise the
exception the ``error`` field names: several classes share a status, and
callers branch on the type. A worker drops a task on ``RunStateError`` alone.
