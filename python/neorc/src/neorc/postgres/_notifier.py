"""Waking waiting workers and schedulers with LISTEN/NOTIFY.

One connection per manager process carries the ``LISTEN``; waiters hold nothing
but an in-process event. Idle workers therefore cost no connections, however
many of them are waiting. A second connection sends the announcements, so an
announcement never queues behind the listening connection's own round trips.

An announcement is a hint: a waiter that is woken re-reads the store, and one
that is not woken falls back on its poll timeout. So a request never waits for
one to be sent, and neither connection may turn a lost link into a manager
that needs restarting. ``notify`` only marks that there is something to
announce; one background task sends a single ``NOTIFY`` for every batch of
marks, on a connection it reopens when it breaks. Opening a connection and
sending an announcement are bounded in time, and the listening connection
repeats its ``LISTEN`` every few seconds, with a bound on the answer, so a
link dropped without a word is found dead within a bound rather than at the
kernel's retransmission limit.
