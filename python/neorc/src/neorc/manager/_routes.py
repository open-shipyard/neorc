"""The manager's HTTP routes: a translation onto ``Manager``.

Flows and runs for whoever deploys and starts them; events, tasks and sub-runs
for the scheduler; task definitions, long-polled tasks, starts, heartbeats and
results for workers.

Bodies and responses are the ``neorc_core._wire`` forms, so the direct and
HTTP clients send the same JSON. A request body is read as bytes, capped, and
checked for nesting depth before it is parsed, and only then handed to a model:
FastAPI's own parsing would hand a deeply nested body to the C parser first.
The models check the shape of the envelope alone; values inside it are checked
by core, so a request the in-memory manager accepts is not refused by HTTP
first, and one it refuses is refused the same way.
