"""Who is asking, and whether a write may come from where it came.

One dependency guards every route of the router. Before the route reads its
body, or FastAPI reads its path and query:

- A write, any method but ``GET``, ``HEAD`` and ``OPTIONS``, is refused when a
  browser says a page on another site sent it (``Sec-Fetch-Site``), and when
  it is not sent as ``application/json``: a form, or a ``fetch`` a page may
  send without a preflight, cannot carry that type, and the manager answers no
  preflight. This holds with authentication off too, where no credential
  stands between a web page and the manager. It needs every route to read its
  body through ``read_body``, never through a declared body parameter, which
  FastAPI would read before any dependency runs.
- With authentication on, the request must carry an API token as
  ``Authorization: Bearer``, or, with sign-in configured, a session cookie;
  not both. A session's write must also come from a page on the public URL:
  its ``Origin``, or with none ``Sec-Fetch-Site: same-origin``, since a
  cookie goes with any request the browser sends. A token is not ambient, so
  a token's request is not checked so. The principal is the dependency's
  value.

Then each route asks, through ``permit``, whether the principal's role may do
the one permission the route needs, on the queue in its path if it names one.
Core decides; a route whose task is on another queue than a worker's is
refused by the manager itself, as not found.

Routes outside the router, ``/health`` and the UI, hold no data and are not
guarded.
