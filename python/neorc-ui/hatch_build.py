"""Build the UI into ``src/neorc_ui/static`` when it is not there.

Runs before hatchling collects files, for a wheel or an sdist. From a checkout
that means ``npm ci && npm run build`` in ``ts/neorc-ui``, with Node.js at the
version in its ``.nvmrc``; from an sdist the assets are already inside, so
nothing runs and Node.js is not needed. An editable install never builds:
Python contributors need no Node.js, and ``neorc_ui.static_dir()`` says what
to do when the assets are missing.
