# neorc

A next generation orchestration system: flows of tasks, defined in YAML files
under version control, run by workers wherever the work is.

This repository is a monorepo. The packages it publishes:

| Package                           | Description                             |
| --------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| [`neorc`](python/neorc)           | Manager service, scheduler and worker commands, Postgres and HTTP adapters |
| [`neorc-core`](python/neorc-core) | The mechanism: flow definitions, the planner, ports, and the manager, scheduler and worker logic |

## How it works

A flow file names its tasks, the queue each runs on, the function that runs it,
and where its inputs come from: the flow's inputs, or other tasks' results. A
**manager** service holds the flows and their runs. A **scheduler** moves runs
forward as tasks finish. **Workers** on other hosts receive the next task on
their queue by long-polling the manager, claim it, run its handler, and report
back.

    scheduler > http > manager > database
    worker    > http > manager > database

Receiving a task takes a *lease*, and the worker claims the task before running
it: the worker heartbeats while it runs, and a task whose lease lapses goes back
to the queue, so nothing is lost when a worker dies. Delivery is at-least-once, so handlers should be idempotent.

## Quick start

Try a directory of flow files in one process, with nothing to deploy:

    uv run neorc run examples/wordplay --flow word_picker \
        --inputs '{"sentence": "potato tomate berry watermelon", "preferred_letter": "t"}'

Or bring up a whole deployment on this machine, Postgres and the web UI
included, with the example's flows loaded and nothing started:

    uv run python examples/demo.py

A deployment installs what each host needs — the base install pulls in nothing:

    pip install 'neorc[manager,postgres]'   # the manager host
    pip install 'neorc[http]'               # scheduler and worker hosts

Start the manager, and create an API token for each process that will reach
it. Every request needs one; `neorc tokens create` prints its secret once:

    export NEORC_DATABASE_URL=postgresql://localhost/neorc
    neorc manager start --create-schema \
        --ssl-certfile manager.pem --ssl-keyfile manager-key.pem
    neorc tokens create scheduler
    neorc tokens create worker-1

A token is sent only over HTTPS, or to a loopback address: serve the manager
with a certificate as above, or behind a proxy that terminates TLS. `neorc
tokens list` and `neorc tokens revoke <name>` manage them. To try it on one
machine nobody else reaches, `neorc manager start --no-auth` asks for none.

Write the work, as plain functions that need not import neorc:

```python
# myapp/tasks.py
def greet(name):
    print(f"hello {name}")
```

Describe it in a flow file:

```yaml
# flows/hello.yaml
name: hello
version: 1.0.0
inputs: {name: string}
steps:
  greet:
    handler: myapp.tasks:greet
    params: {name: inputs.name}
```

Upload the flows, start the scheduler, and a worker on any host that can reach
the manager, with the code the handlers import from, each with its token in
`NEORC_API_TOKEN`:

    export NEORC_MANAGER_ADDRESS=https://manager.internal:8420
    export NEORC_API_TOKEN=neorc_...
    neorc flows upload flows
    neorc scheduler start
    neorc worker start --code-location .

Start a run from anywhere:

    curl -X POST https://manager.internal:8420/flows/hello/runs \
        -H "authorization: Bearer $NEORC_API_TOKEN" \
        -H 'content-type: application/json' -d '{"inputs": {"name": "world"}}'

Or from the web UI the manager serves at `https://manager.internal:8420/ui/`:
the flows, the runs and every task of each, live, as an outline or as a
zoomable graph of the run's steps, with a form to start a run and a button
to cancel one. People sign in to it with an identity provider, as below; a
manager started with `--no-auth` asks nobody, and says so on every page.

[examples/hello](examples/hello) and [examples/wordplay](examples/wordplay)
walk through both ways of running, step by step.

## Signing in with Google or Okta

The UI signs people in with OpenID Connect. Describe the providers, and who
may sign in, in a file the manager reads; secrets stay in the environment:

```toml
# auth.toml
public_url = "https://manager.internal:8420"   # where people open the UI

[providers.google]
title = "Google"
issuer = "https://accounts.google.com"
client_id = "1234.apps.googleusercontent.com"
client_secret_env = "NEORC_GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET"

[providers.okta]
title = "Okta"
issuer = "https://example.okta.com/oauth2/default"
client_id = "0oa..."
client_secret_env = "NEORC_OKTA_CLIENT_SECRET"
groups_claim = "groups"
scopes = ["openid", "email", "profile", "groups"]

[[allow]]
provider = "google"
hosted_domain = "example.com"        # everyone in the example.com Workspace

[[allow]]
provider = "google"
email = "ada@gmail.com"              # one person, by a verified address

[[allow]]
provider = "okta"
group = "neorc-users"
```

    export NEORC_GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=... NEORC_OKTA_CLIENT_SECRET=...
    neorc manager start --auth-config auth.toml \
        --ssl-certfile manager.pem --ssl-keyfile manager-key.pem

Register `{public_url}/auth/callback/<provider id>` with each provider as the
redirect URI, here `https://manager.internal:8420/auth/callback/google`. An
`[[allow]]` entry names a provider and one of `everyone = true`, `subject`,
`email`, `email_domain`, `hosted_domain` (Google only) or `group`; anyone no
entry matches is refused. For Google, an address counts only in a Workspace
or at Gmail, since Google verifies personal accounts made with any address,
so `email_domain` is refused for it: use `hosted_domain`. Everyone signed in,
and every token, may do everything the API allows; roles are for later.

`neorc sessions clear` signs everyone out, and a changed allow list applies
from each person's next sign-in. The manager is served from the root of its
origin; behind a proxy, `public_url` is the address people type.
