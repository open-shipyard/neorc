"""Record a ``word_picker_rounds`` run, as the API sends it, for the UI's tests.

    uv run python scripts/record_ui_fixture.py

Runs ``examples/wordplay`` in memory on a ``LocalCluster`` and writes the
flows, the run, its tasks, its sub-runs and their tasks, in their wire forms,
to ``ts/neorc-ui/src/test/word_picker_rounds.json``. The UI's component tests
render that file, so they see what a real run looks like: loops with their
iterations, a fan-out with its branches, a loop inside it, and sub-flow runs.
