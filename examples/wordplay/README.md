# wordplay

Run it in one process, with nothing to deploy, from the repository root after
`uv sync`:

    uv run neorc run examples/wordplay --flow word_picker \
        --inputs '{"sentence": "potato tomate berry watermelon", "preferred_letter": "t"}'

It prints `["potato", "tomate"]`. `word_picker_rounds` also takes a datetime,
written as a tagged value, and has no output, so it prints `null`:

    uv run neorc run examples/wordplay --flow word_picker_rounds \
        --inputs '{"sentence": "potato tomate berry watermelon", "preferred_letter": "t",
                   "requested_at": {"$datetime": "2026-09-13T10:00:00+00:00"}}'

[python/neorc-core/tests/test_examples.py](../../python/neorc-core/tests/test_examples.py)
runs both flows and asserts what they produce, in memory;
[python/neorc/tests/test_end_to_end.py](../../python/neorc/tests/test_end_to_end.py)
runs them deployed, as below.

## Deployed

The same flows on a manager, a scheduler and a worker per queue. Run each step
from the repository root in its own terminal, after `uv sync`; the first two
are the same as in [hello](../hello/README.md#deployed).

1. Postgres (skip if you have one; set `NEORC_DATABASE_URL` to it instead):

       uv run python examples/hello/postgres.py

2. The manager, and an API token, as in
   [hello](../hello/README.md#deployed): `export NEORC_API_TOKEN=<secret>`
   in every terminal below; or start the manager with `--no-auth` to use the
   UI without configuring an identity provider to sign in with:

       export NEORC_DATABASE_URL=...   # from step 1
       uv run neorc manager start --host 127.0.0.1 --create-schema --no-ui

       export NEORC_DATABASE_URL=...   # in another terminal
       uv run neorc tokens create local

3. Upload the flows:

       uv run neorc flows upload --manager-address 127.0.0.1:8420 \
           examples/wordplay/flows

4. The scheduler:

       uv run neorc scheduler start --manager-address 127.0.0.1:8420

5. Two workers, one per queue: `score_words` runs on `scoring`, the rest on
   `default`. Both serve the code in this directory:

       uv run neorc worker start --manager-address 127.0.0.1:8420 \
           --code-location examples/wordplay

       uv run neorc worker start --manager-address 127.0.0.1:8420 \
           --code-location examples/wordplay --queue scoring

6. Start a run:

       curl -X POST 127.0.0.1:8420/flows/word_picker/runs \
           -H "authorization: Bearer $NEORC_API_TOKEN" \
           -H 'content-type: application/json' \
           -d '{"inputs": {"sentence": "potato tomate berry watermelon", "preferred_letter": "t"}}'

   The response carries the run's `id`; once it has succeeded,
   `curl -H "authorization: Bearer $NEORC_API_TOKEN" 127.0.0.1:8420/runs/<id>`
   shows `"output": ["potato", "tomate"]`, and `/runs/<id>/state` every step's
   result.

[`flow_example.py`](../../docs/specs/flow_example.py) written the neorc way: the
`while` and `for` loops move into flow files, and `tasks.py` keeps only plain
functions.

- [`flows/word_picker.yaml`](flows/word_picker.yaml): `word_picker`.
- [`flows/word_picker_rounds.yaml`](flows/word_picker_rounds.yaml): `word_picker_rounds`,
  extended to use the features `word_picker` does not.

Started with `{"sentence": "potato tomate berry watermelon", "preferred_letter": "t", "requested_at": ...}`,
`word_picker` returns `["potato", "tomate"]`, and `report` pads each word to 8
characters: `["potato**", "tomate**"]`.
